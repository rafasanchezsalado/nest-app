Before updating Node.js, it’s important to check which version you currently have installed. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

`node -v`

For the Latest LTS Version

If you prefer to install the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version, use the LTS setup script:

`curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -`

If you need only the Node.js runtime, follow the Node.js installation steps.

`sudo apt install nodejs -y`

Install the Ionic CLI with npm:
